This is a group project for Data Mining DSCC 240 at the University of Rochester. The purpose of this project is to create better
matchmaking for Rocket League players. Instead of basing a players skills on a ranking system they can instead be compared based
on real-time performance during a game. The data set contains physical characteristics of the player and the ball, such as where
the player is located in relation to the playing field or speed the ball is traveling towards a goal. The data set also contains
controller inputs given by the player as well as if the player scored a goal or not. We based our techniques from a paper 
published by Romain Mathonat.
